# react-jsx-template
React component for style encapsulation. Create scoped styles within your components, also compatible with material-design styled components. Works with the Shadow DOM API and essentially renders the content of the component within the Shadow DOM of the root element. It works a bit like the <template> tag in Vue.js development, except that in this case it contains everything in the component, including the component styles which are scoped.
